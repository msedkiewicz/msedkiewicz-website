              I was interested in programming even before I started studying
              General Psychology. I have created my first WordPress website in
              2011. Since then in my free time I took care of my family and
              friends websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              After years of gaining experience in journalism, copywriting, book
              writing and publishing, psychology and fencing I fulfilled my
              dream and I started my career in IT.
            </p>
            <p>
              From all the things I tried in my life coding gives me most satisfaction. I just love repairing bugs and those moments of insights when, after longer coding, I find solution for the coding problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey started with WordPress. I still work with it, however currently I'm more engaged in React and JavaScript programming.
